# Abstract
The project aims to automate the process of populating Entity-Relationship (ER) schemas by leveraging online data sources. By utilizing Google’s data search API and other web scraping techniques, our system will dynamically fill in the necessary attributes based on predefined relational schemas. The "big idea" is to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of database schema development, thereby reducing manual data entry and improving data quality.

This project addresses the need of creating large test datasets for provided database schemas in user applications. In case of unavailability of online public datasets, we aim to create fake, testing data, taking into consideration all the edge cases of the relations, for the users to test their application or their queries.
